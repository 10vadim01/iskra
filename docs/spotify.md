## Setup
For now it is only possible to play music on spotifyd if user manually connects to device with a spotify client and chooses iskra@spotifyd as the device. \
If user disconnects a device spotipy looses spotifyd.

### Solutions
* Setup spotifyd as a service
* Spotifyd should connect to iskra itself
* Check if spotipy scripts work without VPN in such cases
